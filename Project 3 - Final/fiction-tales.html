          <p class="poems-p"> In the beginning, I saw nothing. </p>
          <br>
          <p class="poems-p"> But that very silence that is the first sign of a feeling, ‑ </p>
          <br>
          <p class="poems-p"> that very thing that signifies nothing ‑ </p>
          <br>
          <p class="poems-p"> is also empty. </p>
          <br>
          <p class="poems-p"> And what is that feeling that signifies nothing? </p>
          <br>
          <p class="poems-p"> Nothingness. </p>
          <br>
          <p class="poems-p"> It is not the absence of a thing, which is my first thought, but rather the absence of a thought. I see that when I try to make a thing stand for itself, that empty space in which it is felt to have no meaning. I see that when I try to define a reality outside my own, this empty universe in which it seems so simple, this cosmos in which it seems so foreign. </p>
          <br>
          <p class="poems-p">And what does that universe mean? It must mean that the laws of gravity, the tension in the atom, the repulsion in the electron, the repulsion in the electron-positron system, the repulsion in the subatomic particle, the attraction between an electron and a proton, the repulsion in the atom, and the repulsion in the atom itself, exist in a universal law of nature, are not separable, and that they contribute to the tension of the atom.</p>
