If you can't afford a home or can't find a suitable partner, then you should probably consider taking on a new job. If it's a good one then I will not hesitate to recommend it. But if it's a bad one, then I will be out of work for a while.\n",
        "Also, it is important to realise that there are still some jobs that a person should not be considering. Maybe you should look for a job where you are paid a certain amount, but you are not asked to do anything outside your job. Perhaps you should consider a job that is not quite as good as a good one and is only a part-time job.\n",
